Payday lenders charge more than necessary to make credit available, but states can lower costs while still enabling businesses to make a profit. For example, Colorado’s 2010 reform resulted in the lowest-priced payday loan market in the country while maintaining widespread access to credit. In 2016, an average payday installment loan of $392 in the state lasted three months and cost $119 (129 percent annual percentage rate, or APR); nevertheless, payday lenders that operate profitably in Colorado charge borrowers in other states much higher prices. In Ohio, payday lenders will be allowed to charge slightly more than in Colorado for the shortest loans and slightly less for those stretching six months or longer, with APRs declining automatically as loan amounts increase. This structure sets up a well-balanced market and enables loans of up to $1,000 without putting consumers in danger.
